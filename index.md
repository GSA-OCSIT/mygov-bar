<p>Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt a tug at the reins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left.  It was the third falling star!</p>

<p>Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.</p>

<p>A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.  The thunderclaps, treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations.  The flickering light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the slope.</p>

<p>At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At first I took it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement.  It was an elusive vision--a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright.</p>

<p>And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous tripod, higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.  A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer.  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me.  And I was galloping hard to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether.  Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.</p>

<p>I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly.  In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.</p>

<p>Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange body.  It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about.  Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me.  And in an instant it was gone.</p>

<p>So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.</p>

<p>As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunder--"Aloo!  Aloo!"--and in another minute it was with its companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  I have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.</p>
